# SSB Database (*EJS Version*)

This EJS project is based off of the characters from Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers fighting game series. This project will demonstrate my skills with using Node.js, Express.js and EJS as well as using MongoDB to store my database.

> Note: This project is using an API that I created. This API is available in another repository on my GitHub.
> Here is the link: (https://github.com/PrimeCoder05/API-Creator)

**This project is currently in development. This README will be updated as the projects progresses.**
